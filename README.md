How did flocking get added/improve the game?
- flocking was implemented heavily using the in class work
- flocking is how enemies move now, making them flock together and runes bounce off of them
- bouncing a rune into a mass of enemies is fun
- new code will be in C# instead of GDScript, but old code is maintained in GDScript (Ashish approved)
- added attributes to the boid.cs script for integration into the game, enemy.gd currently depreciated
- possible todo: add walls to the flocking algorithm as something to avoid

sidenote: I made my own flocking algorithm in the enemy.gd but I did not read the assignment clearly beforehand so I ended up using the in class code instead.
